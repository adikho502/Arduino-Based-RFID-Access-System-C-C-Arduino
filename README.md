# Arduino-Based-RFID-Access-System-C-C-Arduino
Performed DFMEA analysis on eight subsystems using AIAG methodology to identify and mitigate high-risk failure modes. Developed a state machine–driven microcontroller security system integrating RFID authentication, ultrasonic sensing, dual-servo control, and LCD/joystick interface for real-time monitoring and alerts.
